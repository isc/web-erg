    <description>Today&apos;s session is another variant of a threshold workout. Added with a 15 sec burst of power at the beginning and end of each block of threshold. 

Often referred to as EPD&apos;s or Explosive Power Development effort, we make an explosive effort at the start of each effort to produce some lactate, before settling in to 100% of FTP.

Imagine accelerating round a hairpin, and then settling in to 12 minutes of threshold through a field! We then finish each effort with a 15 second sprint for position heading in to a technical section.</description>
