    <activitySaveName>Zwift Academy 2019 Workout #1: Threshold Development</activitySaveName>
    <description>Having a strong threshold is crucial to cycling performance. Whether your goal is to ride as a professional cyclist or simply to get fitter, improving your threshold (FTP) will help you on your journey. Today we will work on &apos;pushing&apos; your FTP up from below and &apos;pulling&apos; from above. Alternating cadences in the first interval will spike your heart rate while the power remains stable. </description>
