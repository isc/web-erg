    <description>This is a race-simulation session, with intervals that are representative of a race, that also works on your threshold power. So not only will you get a taste of racing, but you will get a good training benefit too. 

This is a tough session, so prepare yourself appropriately. Have two bottles on hand and maybe even a gel during the warm up.</description>
