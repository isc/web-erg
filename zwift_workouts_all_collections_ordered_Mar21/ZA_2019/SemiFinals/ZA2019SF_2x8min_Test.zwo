    <name>Semi-Finals.4 - 2 x 8min Test</name>
    <activitySaveName>Zwift Academy 2019 Semi-Finals Workout #4: 2 x 8min Test</activitySaveName>
    <description>Can you produce high aerobic power and repeat it? Today we are testing your ability to repeat high intensity aerobic efforts with 2 x 8min intervals. An athlete with a well developed aerobic engine will be within 5% of their first interval. We will also play with the numbers a little to estimate your FTP. 8min Power can be used to check your FTP, but not normally used to set your FTP. Treat each 8 minute interval as if it were the only effort. Give it FULL-GAS!</description>

            <textevent timeoffset="20" message="The workout for today is all about testing your ability to repeat high intensity aerobic efforts via a 2 x 8 minute test." locIndex="3" />
            <textevent timeoffset="30" message="The 2 x 8 minute test session has been around for a long time, but it is often a misunderstood test." locIndex="4" />
            <textevent timeoffset="40" message="Its use is misunderstood because it is not the most accurate way to predict FTP values, and not why we&apos;re doing it today." locIndex="5" />
            <textevent timeoffset="50" message="However, some riders and coaches do use the test to set FTP values." locIndex="6" />
            <textevent timeoffset="60" message="The reason it is not the most accurate way to predict FTP is due to the shortness of the test." locIndex="7" />
            <textevent timeoffset="70" message="The shorter the test is, the more the anaerobic metabolic system contributes to the power produced." locIndex="8" />
            <textevent timeoffset="80" message="This causes an over-inflation of the predicted FTP, and inaccurate training zones as a result." locIndex="9" />
            <textevent timeoffset="90" message="However, We are including it in Zwift Academy to assess your ability to repeat high intensity aerobic intervals." locIndex="10" />
            <textevent timeoffset="100" message="We will also look at the data produced and roughly predict your FTP." locIndex="11" />
            <textevent timeoffset="110" message="But remember, you would only use this figure to alert you to the possible need of formally testing your FTP with a different method." locIndex="12" />

            <textevent timeoffset="140" message="But if it&apos;s not close, then this should prompt you to complete a more formal test to check your FTP setting." locIndex="24" />
