    <name>EF Pro Cycling&apos;s Red Day Workout</name>
    <categoryOverride>Recovery</categoryOverride>
    <description>EF Pro Cycling&apos;s Alex Howes says &apos;When I&apos;m in the Red, I generally think of activity as optional and any activity that I might do should be geared toward promoting recovery. Some deep breathing and a light spin are great ways to clear the mind and increase blood flow to stimulate recovery. The cadence drills help stimulate recovery without overly taxing the system and I also find that having a few blocks of specific work forces me to be present and step away mentally from daily stressors.&apos;</description>
