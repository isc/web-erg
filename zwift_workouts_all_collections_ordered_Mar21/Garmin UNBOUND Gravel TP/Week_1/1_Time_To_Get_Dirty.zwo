    <activitySaveName>Garmin UNBOUND Gravel Training Plan | Time To Get Dirty!</activitySaveName>
    <description>Welcome to the Garmin UNBOUND Gravel Training Plan! We&apos;re starting off with some easy riding this week at zone 2. In zone 2 training we are stimulating your type 1 muscle fibers, also called slow twitch. Spending time in Zone 2 is essential to improving performance and a zone you&apos;ll spend a lot of time in during ultra endurance events - like UNBOUND! Zone 2 training is one of the most important aspects of any training plan. We don&apos;t always get faster by training faster. UNBOUND Gravel is a grassroots event, organized and managed by folks who are passionate about cycling, and have done so for the primary purpose of providing life-enriching cycling experiences for our event participants.</description>

            <textevent timeoffset="260" message="In zone 2 specific sessions, it&apos;s extremely important that we remain in zone 2." />
            <textevent timeoffset="280" message="This is because we want to ensure we are engaging predominately type 1 muscle fibers and mainly fat as the fuel source." />
            <textevent timeoffset="300" message="As soon as we enter zone 3, we engage some typeIIa muscle fibers and a higher rate of carbohydrates." />

            <textevent timeoffset="60" message="With this in mind, it&apos;s important to understand how exercising at different intensities affects the changes that occur." />
            <textevent timeoffset="80" message="Your capacity to exercise is dependent on your ability to transform chemical energy into mechanical energy." />
            <textevent timeoffset="100" message="Muscles need to synthesize ATP, for muscle contraction." />
            <textevent timeoffset="120" message="ATP generation is achieved by two mechanisms - anaerobic and aerobic metabolism." />
            <textevent timeoffset="140" message="Fats and carbs are the two main substrates, with some contribution from protein." />
        </SteadyState>
        <Ramp Duration="420" PowerLow="0.7" PowerHigh="0.6">
            <textevent timeoffset="10" message="Your exercise intensity as well as muscle fiber recruitment pattern will dictate the energy system and substrate that is activated." />
            <textevent timeoffset="30" message="Which correlates with the different training zones." />
            <textevent timeoffset="50" message="Which is why this zone 2 session is so important." />
            <textevent timeoffset="200" message="The majority of exercise intensities generate ATP through aerobic metabolism." />
            <textevent timeoffset="220" message="Depending on the your level of fitness, and up to 55-75% of VO2max intensity, energy is generated from fat and carbohydrates." />
            <textevent timeoffset="240" message="Although carbs are used at small rates during low and moderate exercise intensities." />
            <textevent timeoffset="260" message="At intensities beyond 75% of VO2max, ATP generation needs to be faster in order to maintain muscle contractile demands." />
            <textevent timeoffset="280" message="Fat cannot synthesize ATP fast enough so carbs become the predominant energy substrate." />
            <textevent timeoffset="300" message="Essentially, going slowly lets your body use fats as fuel and as you increase the pace you increase the demand for carbs." />

            <textevent timeoffset="30" message="Now we are going to look at how we recruit different muscle fibers when we exercise." />
            <textevent timeoffset="50" message="Muscle is composed of 2 kinds of muscle fibers - Type I, also known as slow twitch, and Type II, or fast twitch." />
            <textevent timeoffset="70" message="Fast twitch fibers are also divided in two subgroups called Type IIa and IIb." />
            <textevent timeoffset="90" message="Muscle fiber recruitment occurs in a sequential order." />
            <textevent timeoffset="110" message="Type I muscle fibers are the first ones to be recruited." />
            <textevent timeoffset="130" message="As exercise intensity increases muscle contractile demands increase and Type I muscle fibers cannot sustain the necessary demand." />
            <textevent timeoffset="150" message="Type IIa muscle fibers kick in and eventually as intensity keeps increasing Type IIb will finally be recruited." />
            <textevent timeoffset="170" message="Simple put, slow twitch fibers are used at slow speeds and fast twitch fibers at fast speeds." />

            <textevent timeoffset="30" message="What are the benefits of zone 2 training?" />
            <textevent timeoffset="50" message="In this training zone we stimulate Type 1 muscle fibers." />
            <textevent timeoffset="70" message="Therefore we stimulate mitochondrial growth and function, which will improve the ability to utilize fat." />
            <textevent timeoffset="90" message="By improving fat utilization we preserve glycogen." />
            <textevent timeoffset="110" message="Athletes can then use that glycogen at the end of the race when high intensity efforts are required  and therefore a lot of glucose utilization." />
        </SteadyState>
        <Ramp Duration="420" PowerLow="0.75" PowerHigh="0.65">
            <textevent timeoffset="30" message="Type I muscle fibers are also responsible for lactate clearance." />
            <textevent timeoffset="50" message="Lactate is the byproduct of glucose utilization which is used in large amounts by fast twitch muscle fibers." />
            <textevent timeoffset="70" message="However, lactate needs to be cleared, otherwise it will accumulate." />
            <textevent timeoffset="90" message="This is where your Type I fibers play the role of lactate clearance." />
            <textevent timeoffset="110" message="Zone 2 will improve improve fat utilization and preserve glycogen but we will also increase lactate clearance capacity, which is key for performance." />

            <textevent timeoffset="30" message="That concludes the science lesson!" />
