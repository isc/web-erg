    <description>Welcome to the Rapha Cycling Club Training Camp workout 5. This session is called 20-40s and involves pushing in to Zone 5 for 20 seconds, before taking 40 seconds to recover and going again. This session stresses your system similar to that of a long, steady endurance ride - it&apos;s a great workout to replicate a 3 hour club run or group ride, in half the time. The real training benefit comes via the cumulative training effect of the two blocks - so it&apos;s important you maintain focus and commit to every single surge in effort. 

ERG mode is recommended.</description>
