    <description>Welcome to the Rapha Cycling Club Training Camp Workout 8. This session is a casual endurance ride, for you to ride on feel. We will do 2 x 40 minute &apos;Free Ride&apos; blocks of Fartlek. Fartlek means speed-play in Swedish, and is the focus of todays session - just vary your effort / speed as you feel. If you feel fresh and want to go for a timed climb or sprint in game, then go for it. If you want to cruise - just chill out and let the duration of the session take care of the training stress.

A few varied efforts will be suggested throughout the session - take on the challenges as you feel up for them! Sandwiched between the two 40 minute Fartlek blocks is a 24 minute 30 second block of Over (120% FTP for 30 seconds) - Unders (75% FTP 3 minutes) - some relaxed structure, to keep the mind occupied, and ensure we stress all of our energy systems and muscle types. 

ERG mode is NOT recommended.</description>
