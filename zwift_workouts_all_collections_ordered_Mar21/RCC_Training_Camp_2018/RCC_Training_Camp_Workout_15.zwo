    <description>Welcome to the 15th and final session of the Rapha Cycling Club Training Camp. This session is a casual ride, for you to ride on feel. Fartlek means &apos;speed play&apos; in Swedish, and is the focus of todays session - just vary your effort / speed as you feel. If you feel fresh and want to go for a timed climb or sprint in game, then go for it. If you want to cruise - just chill out! I will suggest a few varied efforts throughout the session - take on the challenges as you feel up for them!</description>
