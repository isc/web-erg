    <name>Zone 2 #1</name>
    <description>Zone 2 training is one of the most important aspects of any training plan. We don&apos;t always get faster by training faster.

In Zone 2 training we are stimulating your type I muscle fibers (slow twitch).

Spending time in Zone 2 is absolutely essential to improving performance.</description>
