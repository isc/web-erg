    <name>Week 4.4 - Free Ride</name>
    <description>This is a chance to get out for your local Club Run, hit the trails or to join a group ride on Zwift. The focus should be on steady paced endurance. Take care not to overdo this session though as you don&apos;t want it to impact on the quality of your other workouts.

Aim to ride predominately in Zone 2 (55% - 75% FTP) and, after you feel warmed up, try to include 3-5 1 min Zone 6 (120%+ FTP) efforts during the first hour. In the final hour put in a 20 sec maximal sprint every 10 min.</description>
