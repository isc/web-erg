    <name>Week 3.4 - Free Ride</name>
    <description>This is a chance to get out for your local Club Run, hit the trails or to join a group ride on Zwift. The focus should be on steady paced endurance. Take care not to overdo this session though as you don&apos;t want it to impact on the quality of your other workouts.

Aim to ride predominately in Zone 2 (55% - 75% FTP) but try to include 2-3 10 min "Sweet-Spot" (85%-95% FTP) efforts during the ride. </description>
