    <name>Week 3.2 - The Rollercoaster</name>
    <description>This Rollercoaster session aims to replicate the demands of a mountain bike ride / event. 

Mountain biking generally involves far more variations in effort compared with road riding - so plenty of surges and time spent being over geared!

We touch upon all of these aspects in todays session, as we complete two blocks of alternating intensity, with top end Zone 6 surges thrown in there to replicate the demands of having to get up and over a steep bank or technical section. Feel free to get out of the saddle during the max efforts if you need to.

We also have a 12 minute Sweet Spot effort in the middle, to help continue to develop our endurance.</description>
