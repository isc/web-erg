    <name>Week 4.4 - Lumpy Ramps</name>
    <description>This session aims to replicate the demands of a mountain bike ride / event, by constantly changing the intensity at which we ride at! Not only does the power demand change, but so does your cadence.

Half of the &apos;ramp up&apos;s&apos; are to be completed at a low cadence of 65rpm, whilst the other half are at your chosen cadence. Meanwhile, the &apos;ramp down&apos;s&apos; are to be completed at a more familiar cadence of 85rpm.

The efforts we complete today are typical of a tough mountain bike ride / race, where you could be riding through any sort of terrain that has varying terrain! </description>
