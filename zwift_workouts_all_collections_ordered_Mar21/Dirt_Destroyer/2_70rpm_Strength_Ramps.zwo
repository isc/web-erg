    <name>Week 1.2 - 70rpm Strength Ramps</name>
    <description>Welcome to another session of the Dirt Destroyer, which contains two ramped efforts, at a low cadence. Each ramp starts at 65% of your FTP and ramps up, so get ready to grit your teeth a little towards the end of each ramp.

The low cadence provides a strength element to the session, which is fundamental to mountain biking. Just think about all the times you are caught at a low speed, having to get over a rocky or muddy section, which really draws upon your strength.
