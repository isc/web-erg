In zone 2 training we are stimulating your type 1 muscle fibers, also called slow twitch. Spending time in Zone 2 is essential to improving performance and a zone you'll spend a lot of time in during ultra endurance events - like UNBOUND! Zone 2 training is one of the most important aspects of any training plan. We don't always get faster by training faster. UNBOUND Gravel is a grassroots event, organized and managed by folks who are passionate about cycling, and have done so for the primary purpose of providing life-enriching cycling experiences for our event participants.",

Moreover, this variable intensity has been proven to be effective at pushing thresholds up.

Here, you will be doing 8-minute reps — two rounds of 2 minutes above (around 90% FTP) and two rounds of 2 minutes below (around 80% FTP).

Here we complete a 2 minute effort at 109% of FTP, critically at 70rpm which really draws on your strength and is what really makes this part of the pyramid a challenge.\n\nMetabolic waste will build up throughout this session, and you will be forced to continue producing power with lactate present - this is known as your lactate tolerance, which we are trying to improve. \n\nThis workout keeps things interesting by changing the intensity and the monotony of a steady state workout. Real life racing is often more comparable to this type of workout than a very steady state type of workout. The changes in cadence also try and mimic the conditions of real world riding.",

You'll burn a lot of matches as you progress through the session, so just try and hold on as long as you can as you will still benefit from the effort.\n\nIn the same fashion - don't go out too hard!

This session helps to give you the confidence that you can push yourself right up to your FTP for over 40 minutes worth of work, while also creating plenty of muscle damage. \n\nWhen you hit lactate threshold, the sensations are hugely different vs riding even 2-3% below - so we need to prepare ourselves. \n\nDepending on how fatigued you are going in to this session, you may need an easy day tomorrow!",

Each 9 minute threshold effort includes a 45 second burst at high intensity at the start and 4.5 minute mark. This session should be moderately strenuous and work your muscular endurance without costing you too much in terms of recovery time.\n\tThink you have what it takes?

Pace yourself and try to go as hard as you can sustain for the entire 20min - you will be scored on the final 20 minute segment. Upon saving your ride, you will be notified if your FTP improved.",

Each block of EPD is made up of a 15 second sprint, before settling straight in to 11 minutes 30 seconds of Zone 3, before a final 15 second sprint to finish the block off. \n\nThe sprints develop your explosive power, while the settling in to Zone 3 forces you to become more efficient at recycling lactic acid. Your body is forced to work hard to recycle the lactic without resting - similar to riding hard up a short climb while in a group and not stopping at the top. Or in a race - making a big effort up a climb, and then having to maintain pace with a fast moving peloton. \n\nERG mode is recommended.",

By riding a little bit over threshold, then a little bit below threshold, we train our body to be more efficient at riding with lactic acid in our legs, which importantly improves our Lactate Tolerance and our FTP.

This test is intended to set your training zones for the duration of the academy and aid us in our selection process for the next stages of the competition. This test is best carried out with a power meter or smart trainer, however a heart rate monitor will suffice, if you do not have access to one. The test starts with a long, progressive warm up followed by some activation work, designed to prime you for the upcoming effort. The warm-up is a vital component to this test and will enable you to perform at the optimum capacity.  On completion of the warm up, it's time for the test! Simply, go as hard as you can for 20 minutes. ERG mode will turn off for the 20 min segment. You're on your own. Pace yourself throughout, trying not to go too hard, too soon but finish with an empty tank, all out. Ensure a good warm down after the test and put your feet up.",

You'll work various energy systems and find it a challenging session on the body and mind.  The session comprises of 3 main intervals: Over / Under Interval - This is to be ridden at a power just below your FTP, however for the first 30 seconds of the interval (and after every 2 minutes) you are required to spike the power closer to your 20-minute power. This interval is often referred to as a redline session, where you literally 'push' your FTP up from below, and 'pull' it up from above.  30 / 30 Interval These are 30 second on and 30 seconds off. The \"on\" element is to be ridden at your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) or the power at your VO2max. Whilst the \"off\" element isn't a full recovery, aiming for mid-zone 2. You will find that perhaps the hardest part of this interval is the \"off\" periods towards the end of the 12 minutes. Micro-Burst Interval  To finish the session, this interval is 15-seconds all-out followed by 30-seconds of recovery. The sprints are seated and high cadence try and maintain a maximal effort from the first 10 seconds to the last 10 seconds of the interval. Note- Some smart-trainers in their ERG mode will be too slow to react to the changes in powers required for this session and you may find it easier to turn the erg. function off.",

You will be fresh for the first interval and might be the tempted to lift the power closer to/above your FTP. Refrain from doing so, as this will only fatigue you going into the final two thirds of the session.  3 x 4 minute efforts at powers just above your FTP, or your 10 mile Time Trial power - The recovery during the efforts are short, be strict on the recovery times, you will find the effort becomes progressively tougher around the mid-way point of the second interval.  5 x 1 minute efforts at your MAP (Maximal Aerobic Power) - This is the power that you can sustain at the limit of your aerobic capacity, or your VO2max. The effort should not be a sprint and you should aim to hold a smooth power throughout the minute.

There are several ways to enhance your max.\n\t\t\n\tIn this session, we focus on an incremental rise of VO2 uptake. This progression allows us to sustain prolonged levels closer to our VO2 max, versus shorter/higher-powered efforts. \n\t\t\n\tWe do 3x 8min ON/OFF blocks, increasing from 20, 30, to 40sec 'On' while reducing the 'Off' durations. The 'Off' intensity is not a full recovery, so oxygen uptake is always being stimulated throughout the 8min blocks.\n\t\n\tWe finish the session with a 4min build. For most athletes, you'll find yourself near your VO2 max within the last minute of this interval. Get ready for a solid workout!",

      "description": "If we plan to \"attack,\" either by dropping friends on a hill during a group ride or going for victory in a road race, your anaerobic power needs to be strong. This session helps build your attacking power level for a solid punch. Short efforts all under 1min will make you feel the burn.\n\n\tAttacking a group in a race or holding onto a fast peloton in Watopia calls for high anaerobic power. Today we hit some high peak efforts at the start–by the end, you will be fighting to keep the power high.\n\t\t \n\tThis session is broken up into two sections. After the warm-up, we complete 4x 30sec high powered maximal anaerobic efforts aiming for 170% of your FTP. To allow you to hit each effort with optimal anaerobic power, we have 5min full recovery between each.\n\t\t\n\tAt the end of the workout, we move into 1min build efforts. These are high power and high force efforts that will also be heart pumping. The recovery time gradually shortens– by the end, we'll have maxed out all energy pathways, forcing us to rely on our aerobic system.",

The twist is that we have a short 7min block of sub threshold effort between each pyramid, an excellent session to push your limits.",

We'll start with a warm-up that includes x3 2:30min priming sessions that should not negatively impact your aerobic capacity if you're at a good level of fitness. Then we'll do a 4min Free ride to act as a good indication of your max aerobic power (MAP) in a fresh state. Because I'm so nice, we'll take a 10min recovery before the next phase. Riders with inadequate lactate clearance may struggle to recover fully from the 12min capacity effort, and this workout is designed to see this in athletes with poor aerobic capabilities. The 10min sub-threshold attempt will be set at a target power below FTP. This is to induce some muscular fatigue before the 12min capacity and stress those riders with poor recovery capabilities, leaving riders with a better aerobic engine to hit higher powers in the 12min capacity.",

      "description": "Over-Under intervals help build top end capacity, quickly. This type of workout is efficient and highly effective. Adding a couple of accurate sessions like this to your weekly training will pay dividends when you take your riding outside.\n    When the hammer is down this summer and you need to hold the wheel in front of you or stay away from the bunch during a breakaway, you will be glad you've completed this session.",

      "description": "Push it to the limits, these 2 min VO2max intervals will help increase the maximum amount of oxygen your body can use and improve your efficiency with which it can use that oxygen. This can lead to improved endurance performance and the ability to sustain higher power outputs for longer periods of time. Additionally, VO2 max intervals also help to increase the body's anaerobic capacity, which is the body's ability to produce energy without oxygen. This can help to delay fatigue and improve overall performance.",
