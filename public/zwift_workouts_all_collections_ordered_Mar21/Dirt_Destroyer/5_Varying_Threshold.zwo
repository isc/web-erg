    <name>Week 2.1 - Varying Threshold</name>
    <description>Today&apos;s Varying Threshold session is centered around your threshold, but unlike for a traditional training plan for the road, there is some specific cadences to ride at for some of the efforts, where we alternate between your chosen / go to cadence and a low cadence as we often end up riding at on a mountain bike. 

We are going to push ourselves right up to our threshold, by completing 6 efforts, split in to two blocks of 3 efforts (90%, 95% and 100% of our FTP). As the intensity goes up, the volume goes down so this session is definitely manageable and is a nice building block rather than leaving you totally exhausted for tomorrow. 

The first block will alternate between your chosen cadence and a low cadence of 65rpm.</description>
