    <description>This is a pyramid style workout, which is an all round session which will help to boost your endurance, but also your strength as we hit the peak of the pyramid. Here we complete a 2 minute effort at 109% of FTP, critically at 70rpm which really draws on your strength and is what really makes this part of the pyramid a challenge.

Metabolic waste will build up throughout this session, and you will be forced to continue producing power with lactate present - this is known as your lactate tolerance, which we are trying to improve. 

This workout keeps things interesting by changing the intensity and the monotony of a steady state workout. Real life racing is often more comparable to this type of workout than a very steady state type of workout. The changes in cadence also try and mimic the conditions of real world riding.</description>
