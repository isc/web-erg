    <name>Lionel Sanders&apos; Yellow Day Workout</name>
    <categoryOverride>Recovery</categoryOverride>
    <description>Lionel Sanders says &apos;These days make up most of my days just because of my training volume. I would certainly not plan on a yellow day to do something crazy high intensity. You certainly can do a bit of your low intensity stuff, as well and your technical stuff, like you do on a red day - but you also have to work a bit, so it&apos;s a great day to do more of your race pace specific work, which isn&apos;t super crazy taxing but also isn&apos;t super easy. I think it&apos;s a good day to plan more sweet spot or mid type intensity workout if you have an intense workout plan for that week.&apos;</description>
