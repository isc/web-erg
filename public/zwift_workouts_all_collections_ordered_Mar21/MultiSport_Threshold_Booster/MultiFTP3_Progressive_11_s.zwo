    <name>Progressive 11&apos;s</name>
    <description>After warming up you will be completing 2 x 11min &apos;progressive&apos; intervals. Starting out with a comfortable sub-threshold effort, you will finish with a 1min above threshold effort.

Finally the session is completed with a 10min steady threshold effort.

After completing 2 progressive intervals, the final effort should feel relatively comfortable. </description>
