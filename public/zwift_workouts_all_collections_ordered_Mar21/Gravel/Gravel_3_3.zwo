    <description>Today&apos;s workout is going to be a sweet ass exploration of your personal limits and will likely break you down to your core so we can rebuild a better and brighter &quot;you&quot;. JK. But it should be fun. A little bit of over-gear that will be at higher power so I recommend adjusting your FTP if you think it&apos;s a little generous.</description>
